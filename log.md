### Day 1: May 12, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Started learning python. played around with basics like naming variables, print,input and len functions.

**Thoughts:** I am very lazy to commit to anything. But I have taken a first step and started this challenge. I am confident that I would commit to this and improve.
